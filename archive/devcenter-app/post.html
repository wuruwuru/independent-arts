                    <p>The team at Pixate is hard at work on a host of new features and capabilities that we can’t wait to show you in the weeks to come. Today, we’re excited to release the beta of one of these new features, Pixate Actions. Actions are scripts that manipulate everything in the Pixate editor. Think of them like macros or plugins that can create prototype elements for you.</p>
                    <p>The idea behind Actions was to create a programmable system whereby anyone could create repeatable patterns and conveniences for the way they work each day, and share them with the rest of the community. Rather than depending on us to add specific abilities to the Pixate UI, we wanted to give everyone the power to extend Pixate as they see fit. Imagine creating standard UI patterns, shared internal components, or commonly used behaviors that combine interactions and animations.</p>
                    <p>Actions can create anything you could create visually in the Pixate editor, as well as act on selected layers. For example, run a “Create standard flip component” action, and it could automatically create a front and back layer and all the interactions and animations to flip them back and forth on tap.
                        <br>

                    <p>
                        <br>
                    </p>
                    <p>The best part is that actions are completely open and use a subset of Javascript, so they’re there for your to modify — or even write your own. To get you started with actions, we’ve loaded some useful samples into your account already, and added a section to the <a href="http://help.pixate.com/knowledgebase/articles/500711-12-actions">Guide</a> on how to use actions.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p><i>(By the way, if you’re in the middle of using Pixate, just refresh to get this feature.)</i>
                        <br>
                    </p>
                    <p>Our hope with actions, and more extensibility options we’ll add in the future, is that the community takes Pixate further than we could by ourselves. We don’t believe coding should be the primary tool for designers to express their ideas, but we want to open up more options to those of you who already know how to code (or want to learn how), while creating a system that everyone can benefit from. And of course, we’ll be adding new official actions all the time (in addition to constantly improving Pixate in other exciting ways).</p>
                    <p>We’d like to encourage everyone to share actions in a new section we’ve created in the <a href="http://community.pixate.com/c/actions">Pixate Community</a>, and if you want to make an official Pixate action, check out the <a href="https://github.com/Pixate/pixate-actions">Github repo</a>. To get started building your own actions, head over to our <a href="http://www.pixate.com/docs/actions/#introduction">API docs</a>, and use the existing samples as a starting point.</p>
                    <p>We’re releasing this feature in beta because we really want your feedback, and we want to see where the community takes it. Pixate now has a free plan, so if you don’t have an account yet, you can <a href="https://app.pixate.com/signup">create one now</a>. We’d love to hear from you on <a href="https://twitter.com/pixate">Twitter</a> or in <a href="http://community.pixate.com/c/actions">our community</a>, and we can’t wait to see the actions you create.</p>
